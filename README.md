# WorkflowDevelopment

Learning repository using a known codebase in order to familarise myself with various tools. Initially coded in Python, it was then ported to C++ (using Visual Studio Code) and also modified to work within Visual Studio Professional/Community.

- **Original Python**
  - This is the folder containing the original code for familiarising Python syntax.
- **Port to C++ using Visual Studio Code**
  - Each of the Python files were then ported to C++ in order to familiarise that syntax. Each C++ code file can run independantly of one another, using VS Code.
- **Modded for Visual Studio Professional or Commuinity**
  - As Visual Studio Pro/Community is designed for larger codebases, it would be useful to know how to use when working on bigger projects. Modifications were required to the code in order to compile and run it all as one project, no longer independent source files.
- **Personal txt Inputs**
  - Inside this folder are the text inputs to the Advent of Code 2021 challenge, my solutions to this is used as the original codebase.
